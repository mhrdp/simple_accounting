# Known Bugs
## Collapsable sidebar acting weird in certain scenario
Possible PC's browser only problem.

This happened when you resize the screen to smaller size until the sidebar collapse automatically. <br />
The way the bug appears was when you open the sidebar while the screen still at its small size in which the sidebar will collapse automatically, then resize the screen back to its original size while the sidebar still open at previous screen size.<br />
This will make the sidebar close automatically, and when you wanted to open the sidebar again, normally you have to click on the toggle at the upper right section of  your screen. However, in this case when you click everywhere on the HTML body, the sidebar will appears, which it should not.<br />
 <b style="color:tomato">This only appears once everytime you change the screen size until the sidebar collapse, open it, and change it back to screen's original size</b>, after that it will back to normal where you open the sidebar using its toggle, and close it using the close icon or clicking anywhere on the HTML body.
